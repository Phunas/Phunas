- 👋 Hi, I’m @Phunas
- 👀 I’m interested in multiscale modeling, and more importantly using general mathematical skills to model the properties of materials.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to finish a PhD
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who will give me a postdoc in a predictive modeling field, but particularly one related to modeling biophysical
problems that improve public health.
- 📫 How to reach me james.brixey@gmail.com or j.brixey@warwick.ac.uk
